					<h3>What is E3?</h3>

Here, video game companies from around the world, who are a part of the Entertainment Software Association, come together to present new works that are in development that will be coming in the near future. This occurs in three days, in which new products and technologies are presented to gamers, partners, and social influencers. The event also conists of a show floor where people can try out demos of new products for the first time. Once per year, this is the opportunity for various people to connect with each other through their passion for video games.</p>

					<h3>Why is it an important event?</h3>
					<p>Not only is E3 important for raising hype for gamers and developers alike, but it also helps developers make connections with publishers. The developers may have several meetings with different publishers and executives, which could lead to retailers that could help the products release in stores. The press conferences that take place, as well as the secret meetings developers take part in during this time, all make E3 what it is now. </p>
